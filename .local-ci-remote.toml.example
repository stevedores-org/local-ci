# .local-ci-remote.toml — Remote-specific configuration overrides
#
# This file allows you to override .local-ci.toml settings when running
# builds on a remote machine via `local-ci --remote aivcs@studio`
#
# Common use cases:
# - Increase timeouts for slower remote machines
# - Disable stages that don't work remotely
# - Use different caching directory on shared storage
# - Skip stages that are redundant with CI

[cache]
# Remote cache directory (relative to project root)
# If unset, uses .local-ci-cache-remote
cache_dir = ".local-ci-cache-remote"
skip_dirs = [".git", "target", ".github", "scripts", ".claude"]
include_patterns = ["*.rs", "*.toml"]

# Override timeouts for slower remote machine
[stages.fmt]
timeout = 180  # increased from 120

[stages.clippy]
timeout = 900  # increased from 600

[stages.test]
timeout = 1800  # increased from 1200

# Example: disable deny stage on remote (security check redundant with CI)
[stages.deny]
enabled = false

# Example: increase test parallelism on powerful Mac Studio
[stages.test]
# Note: command array syntax still applies
# To use environment variable for job count:
# export CARGO_TEST_THREADS=4
# local-ci --remote aivcs@studio test
